A Super Nintendo emulator based on Snes9x, ported to the GameCube. This project is a branch of the [Snes9x GX](http://code.google.com/p/snes9x-gx/) project, aimed to be an alternative for GameCube users. It shares much of the same code, but uses the older 1.43 core, which gives a performance boost for GameCube users for those core-heavy games.

# Features #
  * Four player support
  * Mode 7, Super FX, SDD1, SRTC, SA-1, DSP1, DSP2 support
  * Partial DSP4 support

## Gamecube Features ##
  * Read files from DVD, SD Gecko.
  * Supports snes, 7z, zip files.
  * Save SRAM and State files to Memory Card or SD Gecko.

Be sure to read the [Documentation](http://code.google.com/docreader/#p(snes9xgx143)s(snes9xgx143)t(snes9xgx143)) for instructions on how to use this program.  We are always looking for more volunteers to help write good documentation, translations, or anything.  Contact us if you wish to help.
